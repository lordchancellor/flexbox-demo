# Flexbox Demo Boiler

This is the boilerplate code for my flexbox demo, as detailed on my blog at http://codingjourney.co.uk/a-guide-to-flexbox/, and hopefully soon on YouTube. You can use this to follow along with the guide and save you having to write up a starting site of your own.

The only prerequisite for this demo is Sass, the compiler for which you can find at sass-lang.com, or of course you can take the starting sass and switch it down to CSS, or even port it over to Less if that's your preferred flavour.

---

The demo index.html is divided into three sections; sections 2 and 3 are commented out. I would suggest you remove or comment a section when you are done with it, although it doesn't entirely matter if you choose not to.

It is recommended to place all of your flexbox demo styles into css/sass/partials/_flex.scss.

Enjoy!
