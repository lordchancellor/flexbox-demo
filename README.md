# Flexbox Demo Boiler

This is the boilerplate code for my flexbox demo, tthe video of which is soon to be available on YouTube and possibly a blog. You can use this to follow along with the guide and save you having to write up a starting site of your own.

The only prerequisite for this demo is Sass, the compiler for which you can find at sass-lang.com, or of course you can take the starting sass and switch it down to CSS, or even port it over to Less if that's your preferred flavour.

The demo index.html is divided into three sections; sections 2 and 3 are commented out. I would suggest you remove or comment a section when you are done with it, although it doesn't entirely matter if you choose not to.

Enjoy!
